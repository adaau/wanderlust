Most travel sites are set up to help travellers research a certain destination. Wanderlust helps travellers that want suggestions based on a certain month. For example, if someone has time off in October, while they may have some destinations in mind, it may not be the best time to visit those places due to weather, crowds, etc. .

This was a solo project created while I was a student in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course.
